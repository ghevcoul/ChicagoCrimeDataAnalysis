# ChicagoCrimeDataAnalysis
A Flask webapp showing analysis from the city of Chicago's crime data.

----

Built targeting Python 3.4.3

An in-progess webapp to display various analyses of the [City of Chicago's crime data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). To begin with, I have been using this project to learn about building webapps and database management. 

At the moment, once the database is populated, the Flask app simply shows a graph of the daily crime counts for the entire time period in the database.
